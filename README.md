# Dynamics 365 on Microservices Reference Implementation
This sample ASP.NET Core application demonstrates how it is possible to apply the architecutral style known as *Microservice Architecture* for a Dynamics 365 custom application.
The application is build using the latest Microsoft technolgies and tries to provide an opinionated approach for the most common issues a developer eam faces when building a custom web app.
At the moment, all of this is a *work-in-progress* and there is no actual code pushed into this repo, however as the design evolves we will try to address the following concerns:

* Decomposition
* Authorization & Authentication
* API Composition
* Cross Service Communication
* External Services Integration
* Service Discovery
* Data Management
* Testing
* Logging & Monitoring
* Client-side UI Composition
* CI/CD
* Containerization
* Long running task
